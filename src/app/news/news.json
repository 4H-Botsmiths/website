    "description": "Explorers of the Deep consists of three activities that can be done all at once or individually, making it highly adaptable for classrooms, afterschool programs, clubs and more:<br><br><strong>Ocean Robot Test Tank</strong> is an activity where youth learn how to “ballast” their ocean robot by adding weights to replicate the sinking and floating behavior of a real ocean robot. They will investigate data collected by ocean robots and learn about the value of ocean exploration.<br><br><strong>Ocean Expedition</strong> is a board game where youth navigate their ocean robot around the world while learning key ocean concepts. Topics include aquaculture, climate change, innovation, human impact and the ocean ecosystem.<br><br><strong>Ocean Communicator</strong> is an activity in which young people investigate challenges that ocean scientists, engineers and technologists are currently exploring. They design and advocate for innovations and technical solutions that inspire public action.",

    "description": "Today, FIRST announced an update to the 2021 season with welcome news about the future of the program.  You can find the detailed update here.  While there are a lot of details regarding funds and how that will be handled by the FIRST offices, I want to draw your attention to the acknowledgement of the abrupt season ending on our youth.  Drawing from the announcement, 'FIRST has determined that the 2020 INFINITE RECHARGE game will be replayed for the 2021 FIRST® GAME CHANGERS, powered by Star Wars: Force for Change season. Over the next few months the Game Design Team will be looking at adjustments to the game, all of which you will learn about at Kickoff in 2021.'<br><br>I know that I am super excited to see this come from the program and will give our youth the chance to finish what they started.  Also, I noticed that the new First@Home subsite offers valuable resources that the Program will investigate and look into.  You can find out more about it here.<br><br> As we look to the future, more virtual content is being incorporated into the program.  A new weekly learning plan is being released that promises new ways of engaging and using Technology like we know it can be used!<br><br>Take Care and stay safe!<br>Kenny",
